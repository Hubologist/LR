TODO

Rethink projects section: transparent overalys on hover don't really work on tablets.
Rethink copy. People seem to think that lightradius is actually some sort of lighting solutions company (Eletrik webdesign company is a great example of copy done right).
Play with the idea of having fixed navbars on each section, perhaps coupled with waypoint/skrollr animations.
Try to get typed.js to work for a multiple choice dialogue mini-game in the profile section.
Simplify javascript.
Remove unused Google fonts and save precious loading time.
Rethink contacts section background image?
Try to have projects section work with skrollr.
Optimize html/css.

FUTURE

Divide projects section into Boostrap projects, Ember projects and PHP projects (maybe marketing projects?).
Rename it 'portfolio' instead of projects.
Remove unfoldlisboa.
Add skills section and describe what services I can offer rahter than just enumerating tools.
    -Front-end design and development
    -Single page webapp development
    -Online marketing copy and SEO
