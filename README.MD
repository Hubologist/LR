<h1>Light Radius</h1>
<h2>Personal portfolio website</h2>
<h3>Todo</h3>

<p>Rethink projects section: transparent overalys on hover don't really work on tablets.</p>
<p>Rethink copy. People seem to think that lightradius is actually some sort of lighting solutions company (Eletrik webdesign company is a great example of copy done right).</p>
<p>Play with the idea of having fixed navbars on each section, perhaps coupled with waypoint/skrollr animations.</p>
<p>Try to get typed.js to work for a multiple choice dialogue mini-game in the profile section.</p>
<p>Simplify javascript.</p>
<p>Remove unused Google fonts and save precious loading time.</p>
<p>Rethink contacts section background image?</p>
<p>Try to have projects section work with skrollr.</p>
<p>Optimize html/css.</p>

<h3>Future</h3>

<p>Divide projects section into Boostrap projects, Ember projects and PHP projects (maybe marketing projects?).</p>
<p>Rename it 'portfolio' instead of projects.</p>
<p>Remove unfoldlisboa.</p>
<p>Add skills section and describe what services I can offer rahter than just enumerating tools.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Front-end design and development</li>
	<li>Single page webapp development</li>
	<li>Online marketing copy and SEO</li>
</ul>
